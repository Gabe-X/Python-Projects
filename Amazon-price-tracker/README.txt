To use the amazon price tracker, make sure to execute the command "pip install requests bs4" in the terminal. I created the amazon price tracker because there was an item that I really wanted to buy. Additionally, I wanted to save as much money and time as possible to purchase said item, so I decided to create this price tracker. This price tracker will send an email with the link of the amazon item to notify you if the amazon item falls below a certain price threshold.
